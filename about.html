                <h3>Hello! I'm Ali</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a bioinformatician who likes to live at the intersection of wet lab work and data science. Basically, I get my hands dirty with cells and then crunch the numbers to figure out what's actually happening.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Right now, I'm working as a Project Manager at Epic Systems, where I help hospitals get their cardiology systems running smoothly. It's a bit of a jump from pipetting in a lab, but honestly? The problem-solving is pretty similar.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My journey's been all over the place (in a good way). I studied bioinformatics at Georgetown and received my master's in 2024. That summer, I interned at the NIH studying vascular stiffness through speckle plethysmography. Before that, I went to the University of Florida from 2019-2023 to study Microbiology with a minor in Bioinformatics, where I worked on the C. elegans protein aggregation project. I've done everything from analyzing Arctic sea surface heights using satellite data to segmenting heartbeat waveforms. I spent a summer in Montana studying bacteria, worked in a clinical lab during COVID, and have been lucky enough to publish a couple papers along the way.

                <p>
                    What really gets me excited is taking complex biological data and actually making sense of it, whether that's through machine learning, signal processing, or good experimental design. I'm also passionate about environmental science, which is why I dove into that Arctic oceanography project using deep learning and satellite altimetry.

                <p>
                    Outside work? I'm probably tutoring high school students, exploring DC's food scene, or trying to explain to my friends why bioinformatics is actually really cool.
