                <h3>Hello! I'm Ali</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a bioinformatician who likes to live at the intersection of wet lab work and data science. Basically, I get my hands dirty with cells and then crunch the numbers to figure out what's actually happening.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Right now, I'm working as a Project Manager at Epic Systems, where I help hospitals get their cardiology systems running smoothly. It's a bit of a jump from pipetting in a lab, but honestly? The problem-solving is pretty similar.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My journey's been all over the place (in a good way). I just finished my master's in bioinformatics at Georgetown, and before that I did everything from analyzing Arctic sea surface heights using satellite data to segmenting heartbeat waveforms at the NIH. I spent a summer in Montana studying bacteria, worked in a clinical lab during COVID, and have been lucky enough to publish a couple papers along the way.

                <p>
                    What really gets me excited is taking complex biological data and actually making sense of it, whether that's through machine learning, signal processing, or good experimental design. I'm also passionate about environmental science, which is why I dove into that Arctic oceanography project using deep learning and satellite altimetry.

                <p>
                    Outside work? I'm probably tutoring high school students, exploring DC's food scene, or trying to explain to my friends why bioinformatics is actually really cool.

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me on the tennis court.
